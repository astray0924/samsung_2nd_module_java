If you have read that this restaurant is fabulous, and then you go expecting good food, good ambience and good service, you will just find this last one. The tables are so close together that it is impossible to have a private conversation. The food was not tasteful at all! It is very expensive for what they offer. The wine list is also not very good. There is nothing special about this place... very simple, but pricey. My boyfriend and I did not even have dessert because we wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. I just wonder how Michelin could give a good rating to this restaurant. There are many good places to go in Manhattan, so dont waste your money and your time
